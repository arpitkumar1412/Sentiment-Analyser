# Sentiment-Analyser

• Built a sentiment analyser on the IMDB movie review dataset using two diferent models - RNN and LSTM. Used GloVe and CBOW word embeddings as input for the 2 models.
• Got an accuracy of 80% and 72% respectively for LSTM and RNN. Both the models along with embeddings were implemented from scratch and no ML libraries were used.
• For further details and results, see stcs-report.pdf

# TO run
1. extract data from project.rar to the main file.
2. data (3) file is CBOW embeddings
3. glove.6b.100d is glove embeddings
4. run RNN and LSTM in colab
5. change the location of file(data - data(3)/glove/senti(2)) in both the files while running
6. senti(2) is a combined file consisting of movie review and its sentiment value
